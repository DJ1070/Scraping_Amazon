# Scraping Amazon

Brief project description:
<ul>
  <li>I scraped Amazon.com for this project to attain information about processors, cameras, smartphones, laptops, monitors etc.</li>
  <li>I extracted information from JSONL files and cleaned the data thoroughly. </li>
  <li>I then saved the data for further processing in mySQL Workbench.</li>
  <li>I explored and combined the data by use of queries.</li>
</ul>

The code is based on [Shekar Biswas' code](https://github.com/shekharbiswas/scrape_processor "Shekar Biswas' code").
